# Player Management

The Z-Dashboard provides an exhaustive suite for managing your active and offline player base. Navigate to the **Players** tab via the sidebar to access the master table.

## The Player Overview Modal

Clicking on any player in the table opens their **Player Overview Modal**. This modal is the command center for interacting with an individual user.

### 1. Live Vitals
At a glance, view the player's real-time health and armor (represented by a live-updating bar), their current session ping, and Discord/Steam linked accounts.

### 2. Economy Management
Directly underneath their vitals, you can view their current **Cash** and **Bank** balances.
Click the **Edit** button next to their funds to open a secure prompt allowing you to *Set, Add, or Remove* money instantly without relying on chat commands.

### 3. Moderation Tools
The "Actions" tab provides one-click access to essential moderation features:
- **Revive / Heal**
- **Bring / Go To**
- **Spectate**
- **Freeze**
- **Warn:** Triggers an in-game UI warning popup for the user.

### 4. Danger Zone
For serious infractions, access the Danger Zone to:
- **Wipe Inventory:** Deletes all items currently on the player.
- **Kick:** Disconnects them with a custom reason.
- **Ban:** Opens the advanced Ban Dialog, allowing you to specify a reason and duration, calculating the exact unban timestamp automatically.

## Fun & Troll Actions

Z-Dashboard includes a dedicated suite of "Troll Actions" explicitly designed for having fun with rule-breakers before removing them.

Located under the *Fun & Troll Actions* header:
- 🔥 **Set on Fire:** Ignites the player.
- 💣 **Explode:** Spawns a small, non-lethal explosion at their feet.
- 🖥️ **Fake Crash:** Simulates a FiveM fatal error on their screen.
- 🚗 **Pop Tires:** Blows out all tires of their current vehicle.
- 🍸 **Drunk Mode:** Forces extreme screen blur and wobbly walking animations.
- ⬆️ **Eject:** Violently launches them out of their vehicle into the air.
- 🐾 **Animal Attack:** Spawns a hostile mountain lion to hunt them down.
- 🔄 **Invert Cam:** Flips their entire game screen upside down.
- 👯 **Clone Player:** Spawns an aggressive hostile clone of themselves.
- 🐌 **Snail Mode:** Restricts their movement speed to a crawl.
- 🌪️ **Launch:** Flings them into the stratosphere spinning uncontrollably.
