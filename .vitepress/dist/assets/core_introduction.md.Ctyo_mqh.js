It acts as the intelligent middle-layer between your server&#39;s framework (QBCore, ESX, Ox, or Standalone) and advanced, modern user interfaces like the <strong>Z-Dashboard</strong>.</p><h2 id="why-z-core" tabindex="-1">Why Z-Core? <a class="header-anchor" href="#why-z-core" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Why Z-Core?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Traditionally, scripts are hardcoded to a specific framework (e.g., a script only works for QBCore). If a server switches frameworks, the script breaks.</p><p>Z-Core solves this by using an advanced <strong>Adapter Pattern</strong>. When Z-Core starts, it automatically detects your active framework and initializes the correct adapter behind the scenes.</p><p>This means you can drop Z-Core (and any script built on top of it, like Z-Dashboard) into <strong>any</strong> server, and it will work out of the box without requiring you to change a single line of code.</p><h2 id="key-features" tabindex="-1">Key Features <a class="header-anchor" href="#key-features" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Key Features&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li>🔌 <strong>Universal Framework Support:</strong> Built-in adapters for QBCore, ESX Legacy, and Ox Core.</li><li>🎒 <strong>Inventory Agnostic:</strong> Automatically handles metadata, item wiping, and currency operations across ox_inventory, qb-inventory, and more.</li><li>⚡ <strong>Zero-Dependency Core:</strong> For servers running entirely custom or standalone setups, Z-Core falls back to its own high-speed SQL schemas.</li><li>🛡️ <strong>Built-in Security:</strong> Integrated permission systems, Discord OAuth support, and Master Password fail-safes.</li><li>🚀 <strong>Pre-Compiled for Performance:</strong> Z-Core is shipped as a pre-built Node.js bundle (<code>dist/server.js</code>). It requires <strong>no NPM installations, no building, and no Node.js setup on your host machine</strong>.
